# snSeq-DGE
This package implements a new Bayesian test for detecting differential gene expression over multiple dose groups in single cell gene 
expression studies. 

## Simulating dose-response data
In order to develop new testing methods for differential expression analysis we need data for which the ground truth is known.
Here we simulate dose-response data based on known dose-response models and using parameters derived from real data.
