# scBT
This package implements a new Bayesian test for detecting differential gene expression over multiple dose groups in single cell gene 
expression studies. 

## DGE testing
scBT is an R package for differential gene expression (DGE) analysis in multiple group study designs for single-cell RNA sequencing data. scBT contains a new Bayesian test of the same name designed along with 9 other benchmarking algorithms frequently used for the DGE analysis in multiple group experimental designs. The tests present in scBT are:

* Seurat Bimod ( Two sample test of mean for zero inflated continuous data)
* Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (Non-parametric two sample test for mean)
* ANOVA ( Parametric K-sample test of mean for samples from a normal distribution)
* KW (Non-parametric K-sample test of mean)
* limma-trend
* LRT-multiple(k-sample test of mean for zero inflated continuous data)
* LRT-Linear( Regression model based test of DGE for zero inflated continuous data)
* MAST (Regression model based test of DGE for zero inflated continuous data with Bayesian estimation)

## Installation
Install dependencies
```{r}
# brglm
install.packages('brglm')

# Seurat
install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github(repo = 'satijalab/seurat', ref = 'develop')

# limma
BiocManager::install("limma")
```

The developmental version of scBT can be installed from Github:
```{r}
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("satabdisaha1288/scBT")
```

## Getting Started
Once installed the best place to get started is the vignette. The Quickstart vignette can be accessed as:

```
library(scBT)
DETest(sce, method = 'BAYES')
```
